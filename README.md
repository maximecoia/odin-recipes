# Odin Recipes

This project, Odin Recipes, is a simple website to practice the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. It will contain a collection of recipes with links to individual recipe pages.

Through this project, I will learn:

- How to structure a website using HTML.
- How to style web pages with CSS.
- How to manage a project with Git and GitHub.
